What to Download</h2>

<p>Note: CGNS has switched from SourceForge 
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns</a>)
to GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/CGNS">https://github.com/CGNS</a>). 
<!--Previous stable releases are still available on 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgns/files/"> SourceForge</a>.-->

<p>For the up-to-date release, visit the 
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS">GitHub page</a>.

</p>

<p>Future releases will be made from the GitHub site.

<p>As a minimum, you will need to download and compile the CGNS library code.
Compilation requires an ANSI compliant C compiler.
The source code may
downloaded as a gzipped, tar file:  <br>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Current Alpha Release (not stable):</b>
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/">
CGNS Version 3.3.0</a><br>
This Version implements CPEX 0038 and 0039, adds new functionality to the
parallel capability, and makes extensive changes related to the Fortran library.
<p>Important note for Fortran users:  V3.3 removes the usage of "include cgnslib_f.h".
Instead, from this release forward, one must now employ the module "use CGNS".
Also, if making use of 64-bit integers, Fortran programs must declare the
relevant 64-bit integers via, e.g.:  integer(cgsize_t) integername.

<p>
<li>
<b>Current Stable Release:</b>
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v3.2.1">
CGNS Version 3.2.1</a><br>
This Version 3.2 release provides partial
integration of parallel I/O using HDF5 with MPI. It also implements
the Hierarchy of families (CPEX 0033),
Multiple families (CPEX 0034), and Cubic elements (CPEX 0036).
Compression (rewriting) of modified CGNS files is no longer
automatically done, since this may interfere with parallel I/O. This
may be reenabled within an application with the <em>cg_set_compress</em>
function, or done later through the CGNSview GUI or with the
<em>cgnscompress</em> program in the <em>tools</em> subdirectory.
Conversion programs to and from AFLR3, FAST, and TetGen have also
been added to CGNStools.
<p>
Release 3.2.1 implements the suggestions by Cambridge Flow Solutions
to the CMake scripts and adds routines to set the MPI communicator
for parallel I/O. There are also numerous updates and fixes to the test
cases, tools and CGNStools utilities.
<p>
Note: CGNStools is no longer built automatically, you need to set
the configure flag, <em>--enable-cgnstools</em> if using configure.
</li>
<b>Previous Stable Releases:</b>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/CGNS/CGNS/releases/tag/v3.1.4">
CGNS Version 3.1.4</a><br>
Includes 64-bit integer capability
and updated Tools for viewing and editing CGNS files.
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> is now the default file type,
when CGNS is built with HDF5 version 1.8 or later.
(CGNS can always read or write both HDF5 and ADF
file types.)

</ul>

<p>
(NOTE: if building CGNS with an HDF5 version <u>earlier</u> than 1.8, then links will not work
when using HDF5 file type.)

<h2>Note about Compilers</h2>
<p>Users should be aware that many new features in CGNS require the use of up-to-date
compilers.  For example, older FORTRAN compilers that are not FORTRAN 2003 compliant (such as g77) will not
work for many CGNS features, and are not recommended or supported.
<!--Additionally, the use of a FORTRAN 2003 compliant compiler guarantees FORTRAN interoperability with the 
CGNS C library and, therefore, it is strongly recommended that FORTRAN 2003 coding standards be adopted 
in codes using CGNS when it is feasible to do so.-->

<h2>Note to Users of Version 2.5 CGNS</h2>
<p>Current users of Version 2.5 should read the following short guide:
<ul>
<a href="goingtoV3_3.pdf">Quick Guide to Upgrading from CGNS v2.5 to v3.x</a>
</ul> 
<p>which describes some of the reasons for upgrading to the latest version 3 software as well as how to
handle portability issues between versions.

<h2>Known Bugs/Issues in Latest Official (Stable) Release</h2>

<ul>
<li>In the file /cgns/trunk/src/cgnslib_f.h.in, the comment lines on the first 28 lines should be
changed from "c" to "!".  This has been fixed in the SVN version of the code.
<li>In the file /cgns/trunk/src/cgnslib.h, the macro I could conflict with the I in complex.h (if used).
This has been fixed in the SVN version of the code by redefining I to Ii.
<li>Parallel cgp_open can show major slowdown when many processors are employed.  This issue is 
being worked.
